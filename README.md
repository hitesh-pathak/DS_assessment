# Shared Bike demand study.

Study the dependence of Shared Bikes demand with respect to several independent variables like

- Temperature
- Windspeed
- Weather

And to figure out which independent variables are most significant in predicting bike demand.

I've organised the analysis is 3 different notebooks:

1.  [Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/hitesh-pathak/DS_assessment/blob/main/Bike_demand_data_pre_processing.ipynb): This  notebook involves ingesting data into pandas from google sheets and other preliminary steps before analysis.

2. [EDA](https://github.com/hitesh-pathak/DS_assessment/blob/main/Bike_demand_EDA.ipynb): This notebook contains visualization of various relationships between variables to infer the nature of data. Basically Exploratory data analysis.

3. [Model Building](https://github.com/hitesh-pathak/DS_assessment/blob/main/Bike_demand_Model_Building.ipynb): Lastly, this notebook shows the models that I've trained on the data, and the final results.

The notebooks do not depend on one another for execution (obviously) but one notebook might refer to the analysis conducted in the prior ones.

- [final_model.sav](https://github.com/hitesh-pathak/DS_assessment/blob/main/final_model.sav): This is the pickled file, with the final model from which results have been obtained.
